# Rock Paper Scissors Game

This project is a simple browser-based Rock Paper Scissors game where users can play against the computer. The game is implemented in JavaScript and displays the result dynamically on a webpage.

## Project Description

The Rock Paper Scissors Game allows users to input their choice of rock, paper, scissors, or a special "bomb" option, which guarantees a win. The computer randomly selects its choice, and the game determines the winner based on the standard rules of Rock Paper Scissors.
